1. Azure Integration Solution

```bash
This process involves setting up a backend integration solution using Azure services, particularly Logic Apps and Service Bus, within a resource group named "Processing-Order."
The solution encompasses two main events:
  queue polling
  message processing
It is the part of distributed systems and event-driven architectures.
The workflow begins with incoming HTTP requests being validated and then either queued for processing or rejected based on their content.
Messages queued for processing are retrieved and processed at regular intervals, with the solution ultimately exposed as a secure RESTful API.

This approach enables asynchronous communication, scalability, and reliability in handling data processing tasks within a cloud-based environment.
