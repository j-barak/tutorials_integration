1. Azure Integration Solution

```bash
This process involves setting up a backend integration solution using Azure services, particularly Logic Apps and Service Bus, within a resource group named "Processing-Order."
The solution encompasses two main events:
  queue polling
  message processing
It is the part of distributed systems and event-driven architectures.
The workflow begins with incoming HTTP requests being validated and then either queued for processing or rejected based on their content.
Messages queued for processing are retrieved and processed at regular intervals, with the solution ultimately exposed as a secure RESTful API.

This approach enables asynchronous communication, scalability, and reliability in handling data processing tasks within a cloud-based environment.

2. Jenkins Install AWS

```bash
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to installing and configuring Jenkins on an AWS t2.micro EC2 instance.
It begins with setting up the EC2 instance, configuring security groups, and accessing the instance via SSH.
The installation process involves installing Java version 11, adding Jenkins repository, importing validation keys, and installing Jenkins.
Optional steps include installing fontconfig.
Following installation, Jenkins is configured by running the WAR file on port 8200, accessing the UI, and setting up the node as a runner/executor.
Swap space management and running Jenkins in the background are also covered.
This tutorial ensures a smooth setup for utilizing Jenkins on AWS for continuous integration and deployment workflows.
